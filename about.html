        <p>This website is a showcase for all the art I have done plus the CSS coding that I am doing. It is mainly an experimental CSS project that I will use to constantly edit and add more code to test out new animation techniques.
            </p>
        <p>The main menu uses an h1 style CSS animation with many span tags being utilized to move up on a mouseover situation. When you hover over a mouse, the selection gets highlighted and rises over the menu bar. Only one link works, however, but it is still a functioning menu bar.
            </p>
            <p>The box area uses a certain animation tag that expands whenever the mouse is hovered onto it, turning into a sub menu. With that, I have used a certain code to hide everything until the menu expands, revealing the contents inside like a book. This way, I am able to condense everything in a working order.</p>
            <p>The buttons themselves are a preview to all of the pictures I have done. By hovering over a button, the image enlarges, revealing the expanded picture.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, the keyframed animation is a play button moving to and fro. This is a six framed animation.</p>
